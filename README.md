Ruin the Show is an interactive exhibit that takes you behind the scenes of a game show as the producer, where you manage the lights and cameras to make the show run smoothly. Ruin the Show was also inspired by the 1950s Quiz Show Scandals, where producers would have certain contestants cheat in order to boost their ratings, so in Ruin the Show, you are also trying to cheat without getting caught - the more you successfully cheat, the higher your ratings go!

## Meet the Team
Ruin the Show was created by a team of designers and developers from the Rochester Institute of Technology, partnering with the Strong Museum of Play as their Senior Capstones for New Media Design (BFA) and New Media Interactive Development (BS).

## Implementation
Embed pictures / videos (after Imagine) of it being used

## How It's Made
(icons of tech stack, maybe in a client-server-hardware table)

### Navigating the Repo 
[insert file directory visualization]

explain the contents of each folder / file at a high level 

### Running the project
How to get started from scratch (what I had to do to get it on the New Media computer basically)

Also mention the keyboard controls option for if you want to test / use without the hardware

### Hardware
Tech, justifications for why we used the tech, problems encountered, what is going on in each section 

Images: Arduino mock up (ask Max what visualizer he used at the beginning of the semester & try and get a diagram of what we currently have - work with Brandon), image / diagram of the actual podium 

In this section, include that, on certain actions, information is being sent to the server. 

### Server
Tech, justifications for why we used the tech, problems encountered, what is going on in each section 

Highlight and break down the state machine 

In this section include how information is transferring from server to client 

### Client
Tech, justifications for why we used the tech, problems encountered, what is going on in each section 

Highlight the spritesheet class & anything else unique
