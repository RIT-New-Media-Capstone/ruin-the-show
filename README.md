(Overview - needs more)

Ruin the Show is an interactive exhibit where you are the producer of a game show, and need to manage all the moving parts to keep the ratings up. (Add more about the partnership between RIT & Strong, NMID & NMD, etc)

## Implementation
Embed pictures / videos (after Imagine) of it being used

## How It's Made
(icons of tech stack, maybe in a client-server-hardware table)

### Navigating the Repo 
[insert file directory visualization]

explain the contents of each folder / file at a high level 

### Running the project
How to get started from scratch (what I had to do to get it on the New Media computer basically)

Also mention the keyboard controls option for if you want to test / use without the hardware

### Hardware
Tech, justifications for why we used the tech, problems encountered, what is going on in each section 

Images: Arduino mock up (ask Max what visualizer he used at the beginning of the semester & try and get a diagram of what we currently have - work with Brandon), image / diagram of the actual podium 

In this section, include that, on certain actions, information is being sent to the server. 

### Server
Tech, justifications for why we used the tech, problems encountered, what is going on in each section 

Highlight and break down the state machine 

In this section include how information is transferring from server to client 

### Client
